Not implementing single column tables. (?)

It would be nice to be able to shunt any text representing a table in and still use without needing the external lexer that inputs into this. Maybe active pattern match on the thing coming in, if it's not a string convert it to a string. Perhaps that's extending my workload a lot.

## From TC below:


## How will (or might) your code contribute to the group deliverable? What have you done to ensure interfaces etc will be compatible? What are your interfaces (enough information for your module to be used by someone else not in your team. Assessment here is based on best efforts while allowing independent development, not whether the code is actually useful. Typical length 1/4 page.

Submit to the EEE upload link a zip file of an F# project with your working code + tests. Documentation a single markdown file README.md + comments in code as needed. There is no maximum length, typical lengths included to prevent excessive report-writing. Specifically include the following in your markdown file.


## What is the specification of your code? Detail any areas where spec was initially unclear and has been clarified. Typical length 1/2 page + Tables.

Your markdown file can refer to comments in code, or the code itself, for details of normal functionality. Your markdown file should contain a precise description of how much functionality has been implemented, and how much tested (tables of features are good for this).

A precise specification document would be very long: your document should only detail issues not obvious from the initial spec that needed to be resolved.

A short description of your Test Plan. Typical length 1/2 page + tables. What you have tested will be clear from the feature specification which includes test status. How you have tested it must be itemised. Again a table is good (could be the same one as used for specification). Add any rationale for your test plan.

Anything notable learnt during testing.
