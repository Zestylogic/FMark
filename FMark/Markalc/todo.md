# Milestones
- [x] Parse one row of tokens into 1D array of Cells.
- [x] Succesfully parse input into a 2D-array of Cell objects.
- [x] Add result monads to all functions (return unchanged token list list on error).
- [x] Create expression parser for arithmetic expressions
- [x] Get CellRef evaluating to implement basic arithmetic on 2d-array of cells
- [ ] Write spec
- [x] Add an extra function (e.g. SUM(CellRef, CellRef))
- [ ] Do the above but process inline markdown of numbers as numbers, keeping calculated result with format. e.g. _0_
