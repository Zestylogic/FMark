# Doing at the moment
- [ ]  Add result monads to all functions and test for incorrect tables. Return Error<Token list list> that is input.

# Milestones
- [x] Parse one row of tokens into 1D array of Cells.
- [x] Succesfully parse input into an 2D-array of Cell objects.
- [ ] Add result monads to all functions.
- [ ] Create lexer/parser for DSL, start with a symbol and basic arithmetic operations between cells. (Requires expression parser)
- [ ] Combine the two to successfully implement basic arithmetic on 2d-array of cells
- [ ] Do the above but process inline markdown of numbers as numbers, keeping calculated result with format. e.g. _0_
